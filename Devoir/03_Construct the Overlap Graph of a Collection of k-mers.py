# Construct the Overlap Graph of a Collection of k-mers

"""In this chapter, we use the terms prefix and suffix to refer to the first k − 1 nucleotides and last k − 1 nucleotides of a k-mer, respectively.

Given an arbitrary collection of k-mers Patterns, we form a graph having a node for each k-mer in Patterns and connect k-mers Pattern and Pattern' by a directed edge if Suffix(Pattern) is equal to Prefix(Pattern'). The resulting graph is called the overlap graph on these k-mers, denoted Overlap(Patterns).

Overlap Graph Problem
Construct the overlap graph of a collection of k-mers.

Given: A collection Patterns of k-mers.

Return: The overlap graph Overlap(Patterns), in the form of an adjacency list."""


def Prefix(Pattern):
    return Pattern[:-1]


def Suffix(Pattern):
    return Pattern[1:]
